    - Admin can delete a task only if that task is not yet started by the member

    - Admin can assign different projects with tasks to individual

* User Portal: 
    - Once logged in user will be able to see his project, project manager name and his assigned tasks
    - At least one task should be started to post status for that day

    - He can start and end his tasks which will show as completed.
